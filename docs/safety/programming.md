### Programming Safety Rules
These rules encompass the hazards that occur in the programming department, such as running or testing the robots code. Rules are not limited to these, as different circumstances arise.

### General Safety
* Use common sense
* Make sure people are aware that the robot is running before conducting tests in order to avoid accidents. For example, yell “ROBOT ON” when turning on the robot
* Do not enable the robot while people’s hands are inside
* Make sure teammates are aware before actuating any mechanisms
* Stay aware of your surroundings and others around you when working
* When testing robot code, keep an eye on the emergency stop button in the event that something goes wrong with the robot.
