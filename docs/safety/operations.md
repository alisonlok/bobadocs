# Operations Safety

These rules encompass the hazards that occur in the Operations department, put in place to assist the assembly and ensure safety in the use of various visual displays that promote FIRST and our team.

### Display Safety:

**Indoor:**
The display should not block emergency exits or hinder evacuation
Ensure that the display can support its own weight and stand without falling over or collapsing
Always securely anchor the display to the wall or floor when given the opportunity
Shelves and tables should lack sharp edges or corners, and should only carry the amount of weight they are rated for

### Pit Safety:

The Pit area at competitions is a 10 ft x 10 ft area that FIRST provides for a team to assemble and fix their robot before and after matches. In order to optimize the space given while maximizing efficiency, comfort, and safety, certain rules must be put in place. A pit should also present a welcoming and positive atmosphere in an effort to eliminate as many stressful and possibly harmful conditions as possible.

*A proper pit should include (but not limited to):*

- First Aid Kit
- Battery Spill Kit
- Safety Captain
- Organized toolboxes
- Separation of department equipment
- Set-aside area for robot to stay while being worked on
- Inviting marketing display
